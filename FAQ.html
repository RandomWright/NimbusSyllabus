            <H2>Welcome to Nimbus Syllabus!</H2>
            <p class="answer">Nimbus Syllabus is a powerful and imaginative way to elevate a college student's academic career. Every semester we undergrad students are subjected to an immense amount of paperwork. From syllabi to assignments to exams, we are tasked to organize and champion every intricate detail that is embedded in ink and paper. And, as each week passes, we have to write up papers, hand in code, and show up on time to important events. Over the past few years, systems have been introduced to simplify this overwhelming mess of responsibilities. Blackboard, Piazza, and independent tools like iStudiez and Google Drive all come to the aid of the stressed out pupil. As virtually every member of the higher education system would admit, however, every single one of these has flaws and complications that make them non-ideal. Nimbus Syllabus is a webapp meant to close the gaps between these platforms, meant for any student on the University of Rochester campus. In order to solve the numerous problems with organizing, creating, and sharing our schoolwork, we have designed the foundation for a creative and algorithmically intelligent project.</p>
